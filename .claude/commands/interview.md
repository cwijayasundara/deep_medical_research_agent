# /interview — Requirements Gathering

You are conducting a structured requirements interview to produce a focused requirements document. The user has an idea for a feature or project but may not have written formal requirements yet.

## Process

### Phase 1: Understand the Vision (1-3 questions)
Ask about:
- What problem does this solve? Who is the user?
- What does success look like? How will they know it's working?
- Are there existing systems this needs to integrate with?

### Phase 2: Clarify Scope (2-4 questions)
Ask about:
- What are the must-have capabilities vs nice-to-haves?
- What are the constraints (timeline, tech stack, team size)?
- Are there any known technical risks or unknowns?
- What should this NOT do? (anti-requirements)

### Phase 3: Define Quality Attributes (1-2 questions)
Ask about:
- Performance requirements (latency, throughput, scale)
- Security and compliance requirements
- Availability and reliability expectations

## Rules
- Ask ONE question at a time using the AskUserQuestion tool
- After each answer, decide if you need to go deeper or move to the next phase
- Keep the total interview to 5-8 questions (adapt based on complexity)
- If the user says "that's enough" or similar, wrap up immediately

## Output
When the interview is complete, synthesize the answers into a requirements document:
1. Write to `docs/requirements.md` (or `$ARGUMENTS` if a path was given)
2. Format:
   - **Problem Statement**: 2-3 sentences
   - **Target Users**: who benefits
   - **Functional Requirements**: numbered list of capabilities
   - **Non-Functional Requirements**: performance, security, reliability
   - **Constraints**: tech stack, timeline, integration points
   - **Out of Scope**: explicit anti-requirements
   - **Open Questions**: anything still unclear
3. Tell the user: "Requirements captured. Run `/decompose docs/requirements.md` to break these into stories."

DO NOT implement any code. Requirements gathering only.
